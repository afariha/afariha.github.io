				  In total, I drove about 3500+ miles in 10 days with a total
				  driving time of about 60 hours. The days were very diverse, full of
				  surprises. The weather never failed to surprise me. I saw rain, cold,
				  sun, snow, mist, and wind. I saw river, falls, lakes, mountains, sky,
				  tree, people, and animals. I ate a diverse types of food and lived in
				  different kinds of home in airbnb. I passed many toll plazas, visited
				  many rest areas, and gas stations. Some of the food I bought from gas
				  stations, I loved them, but I don't know where to find them again. I
				  changed lanes a thousand times, passed thousands of cars and trucks.
				  After 10 days of morning routine of <em>pack your things, load your car,
				  and keep driving</em>, I am feeling <em>stuck</em> today, a little bit of
				  goalless as well. I don't have anywhere else to go any more, all I need
				  to do is just <em>stay</em>. The trip was a bit tiring, but would I
				  repeat it again? <em>hell yes</em>!
