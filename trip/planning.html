				Planning the trip was the easiest part. All I needed to ensure
				is that I don&rsquo;t drive more than 6 hours per day, because, otherwise,
				it will be too much. I could not equally distribute daily driving duration
				because there isn&rsquo;t always a decent livable place at the exact mark.
				I had much trouble in finding a decent town in South Dakota, there
				aren&rsquo;t many that falls on I-90, but, I managed to find one called
				<em>Kadoka</em>, which is almost an <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram" target="_blank">anagram</a> of
				Dakota! Other than that, it was pretty simple: find a town near I-90, and
				find an airbnb there. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_90"
				target="_blank">Interstate 90 (I-90)</a> is the <em>longest</em> interstate
				highway that connects Massachusetts and Washington, from east to west. When
				I drove through I-90 during my stay at Washington, I could never believe
				that this is the same I-90 I drive in Massachusetts. Now is the time to
				actually <em>verify</em> it!

			I planned to stay 2 days at Minnesota as it is kind of the middle
			of the trip, so I could use an extra day for resting and recharging (and
			perhaps do some laundry!). I am planning to meet my friend <a
			href="https://xahidbuffon.github.io/" target="_blank">Jahid</a> there, so
			booked a nice airbnb near Madison Lake. I am also planning to do a little
			bit of sightseeing on my way, perhaps <a
			href="https://www.nps.gov/badl/index.htm" target = "_blanl">Badlands
			National Park</a> and <a href="https://www.niagarafallsstatepark.com/"
			target="_blank">Niagara Falls</a>, but it all will depend on how I feel
			after this marathon road trip! The other thing I made sure is the condition
			of the car: I changed the tires, drive belts, brake fluids etc. to make sure
			that the car is in good shape and will not just break (hopefully!) in the
			middle of the trip. I even did an interior detailing so that I feel good
			about staying inside the car during the entire trip. One small thing that
			really made me happy is when the car service consultant said, &ldquo;It's
			ready to go to west!&rdquo; At that time, I felt like, <em>finally</em> it
			is happening!
