				I am about one thousand miles away from Sunderland now. Despite
				the weather being good today, it was the hardest drive. The reason was that
				I had to pass through Chicago, one of the biggest cities of the USA. I
				passed three state borders today: <em>Indiana</em>, <em>Illinois</em>, and
				<em>Wisconsin</em>. I also crossed a time zone, now I am in the Central
				Time Zone, one hour lagging from the Eastern Time Zone. At the beginning,
				the road was pretty empty, since today was a weekend. At some point, there
				were two options, to go back to Toledo via I-90 east or to move towards
				Chicago via I-90 west. I proceeded towards Chicago. I spotted a few New
				York cars today, and felt like seeing some known <em>neighbors</em>! There
				were two possible routes to cross Illinois, one through Chicago and the
				other through Joliet, but the latter was much longer. I have a particular
				interest in the Joliet Prison as the famous TV show Prison Break was shot
				there, and which I visited once already. So I rather went for the more
				direct Chicago route. After I entered Indiana, the road signs changed a
				little, and I spotted a number of cars and trucks from many different
				states: Nebraska, Nevada, Maine, Indiana, South Dakota, Illinois, Ohio,
				Kansas, Arkansas, Missouri, Michigan, and so on. The hardest part was when
				crossing Chicago: the road was very busy and a few drivers were driving
				recklessly. Thanks to Google Map, it suggested me an alternate route
				through Indianapolis that avoids a crash and also saves 6 minutes. Illinois
				has I-Pass for toll. I was worried the entire time about getting some
				penalties, since I didn't have an I-Pass, but later I found out that I
				already had an I-Pass (EZPass) which I was unaware of. Apparently, EZPass
				covers I-Pass! When I was nearing Chicago, the sky became less clear and
				looked dusty, the same happens when I approach other big cities like New
				York, as all big cities are huge source of pollution. In today's breakfast,
				I had the leftover from last night's dinner, so didn't need to stop for
				breakfast. But I did stop three times today, first time for refueling, and
				later to get a Starbucks cold coffee (decaf of course).

				Today's <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/21674176"
				target="_blank">airbnb<a> was just OK, the basics. It had an outdoor patio
				where I had part of my lunch. It was getting colder and I moved inside in
				the middle of the lunch. One good thing was that this airbnb had washer and
				dryer so I could do some laundry. Madison has a bit different landscape, it
				seemed kind of dry and less green.
