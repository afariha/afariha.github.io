				They day started as a gloomy day, with a little rain. As I kept
				going north, the rain kept increasing, and eventually turned into snow. The
				temperature, when I started, was in the 40s, then it kept going down and
				down, and at some point it went down at the low 30s, and rain became snow!
				To make things even worse, there were so much fog and mist. At some point,
				I even turned on the flashers so that other cars can see mine! The driving
				wasn't a pleasant one, I could hardly see anything due to
				rain/snow/fog/mist (maybe also small sized hails!). The good thing was that
				since the temperature was pretty high, the snow immediately melted, which
				didn't leave the highway slippery. The other interesting thing was, there
				were so many trucks in the road! I'd say there were 95% trucks and 5% other
				vehicles. I was feeling like a truck driver with the only exception that my
				&ldquo;truck&rdquo; was a sedan. Other than that, my trunk was also full of
				cargo as those trucks! I tried to read the license plates of some of the
				trucks. A number of them were from New York, Illinois, or Ontario. That
				reminded me, the border is closed for humans, but open for trucks! Hmm...
				interesting! The moment I started I-90 west, I felt something, I am finally
				&ldquo;off to west&rdquo;

				Meanwhile, this is what happened to my car. The entire front part
				was covered in ice. I wonder what if I didn't have an EZPass, how would
				they read my license plate? With a mild kick, I removed
				the ice on top of the license plate, just in case!

				The host left a nice welcome message for me. There were some snacks and juice bottles.
				I ate a pack of Doritos, a pack of trail mix, and two bottles of cranberry juice.
				Then I ordered dinner from Applebee's via DoorDash. It was super simple, in fact, 
				this is the first time I tried DoorDash. Late afternoon, I found my hands to be
				super dry, much drier than usual. Then I thought what did I do differently today
				than my regular days? Well, the culprit was the car heater! I do not leave my hands near
				hot air about 6 hours every day. Then I went to CVS to get some hand cream and also
				get a view of the city. Batavia is a small town, much similar to Amherst. People
				are not rushing, they are just relaxed. I was thinking who stays here overnight in
				hotels/airbnbs? If someone wants to visit Niagara falls, they'd rather stay in Buffalo.
				Apparently people like me stay here!

	  			The place was clean and nicely decorated. I found a book about rock music, basically an
	  			alphabetical list of famous rock bands, their pictures, quotes, and short notes on them. 
				I was glad to see a few of my favorites there.
	  			There was another book on Lake Powell and Grand Canyon as well, with lots of cool pictures.
	  			I spent some time checking out both of them.
