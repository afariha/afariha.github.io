				  I admit that after 5 days, now this is not as much fun. But
				  the show must go on, and I am particularly looking forward to the west
				  part of the country! I entered South Dakota today. The entire drive was
				  mostly a straight line. The prettiest part in today's road trip was
				  crossing the Missouri river. Right after crossing it, suddenly the
				  landscape changed drastically. There was heavy rain today and I had to
				  cancel (hopefully postpone) my plan to visit Badlands National park.
				  Despite being extra careful to make sure that all parts of my car is
				  properly functioning before starting the trip, I missed the wiper. Turns
				  out, wiper is no less important than driving belts or brake fluids. I was
				  worried about my wiper blade just tearing off at any point during the
				  heavy rain. Luckily, it is still hanging in there and giving somewhat
				  poor service. South Dakota crosses a time change line. My trip started at
				  <em>Central Daylight Time (CDT)</em>, and ended at <em>Mountain Daylight
				  Time (MDT)</em>. Sun was showing itself intermittently during the heavy
				  rain, but finally decided to say me goodbye for today at some point and
				  there was no more show. I saw a few lightnings as well, perhaps there was
				  a thunderstorm in a remote place. I-90 in South Dakota has a speed limit
				  of 80 mph in most of it. At some point, I tried to speed up and touched
				  110, but I was hearing a weird sound at that speed so immediately slowed
				  down. I saw a group of deers crossing the highway once, and a few deers
				  lying dead on the side of the road. Strangely, I saw a few places where
				  it says I-90 is closed when lights flashing. This is the first time I am
				  seeing something like this where they close interstate highways
				  occasionally and there is a permanent flashing light for that!

				  Today's <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/20618945"
				  target="_blank">airbnb</a> was very big, it had 3 bedrooms, too much for
				  a solo traveller like me. I loved that it had a piano, after such a long
				  time I played a little. Unfortunately I forgot a lot of things due to
				  lack of practice over a year. Since it's muscle memory, there is no way
				  to bring it back instantly, I have to relearn.
