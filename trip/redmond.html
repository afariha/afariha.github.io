				  I reached Redmond today, finally! Today was the worst day in
				  terms of driving effort. I started really early in the morning, at around
				  6 AM. It was just a 4 hour drive and I was supposed to reach Redmond at
				  around 10 AM. Unfortunately, at Easton, I found that I-90 was just closed
				  due to a crash and extremely bad weather near Snoqualmie pass. I checked
				  the WSDOT website and it said that due to the uncertain nature of weather
				  condition, it is unknown when the road will open. I initially thought to
				  wait for a bit and waited for about an hour. Then I rerouted through
				  highway 2 via Leavenworth, it was 3.5 more hours, but I went for that
				  anyway. On the way, I saw beautiful Leavenworth and refilled my car's
				  fuel tank. When I crossed Stevens pass, the weather was inclement as
				  well. The road was slippery due to snow. I found it surprising that with
				  this little snow Washington struggles so much. If it was Massachusetts,
				  this would be no big deal at all, MA is always prepared for snow, roads
				  are never closed. There is a meme that in MA we plow snow to make room
				  for more snow! After about 8 hours driving, I finally reached Redmond, my
				  new home. The remaining of the day was as smooth as it could be. With
				  this, I completed my 10-day road trip.

				  This is how the rooftop lounge looks like and view from it. I
				  think Rainier must be visible from here, but not with this much cloud.
