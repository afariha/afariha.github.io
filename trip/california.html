				Right after defending my Ph.D. dissertation, I needed a real
				vacation. I decided to visit California and visit my cousin there, and also
				visit some of the national parks. I visited Kings Canyon and Sequoia
				national parks. Although I wanted to see Yosemite, but couldn't due to
				requirement of day pass, which I didn't collect before. Anyway, this gives
				me some motivation to visit California again. Honestly speaking, I didn't
				like California that much the first time I visited, perhaps due to Los
				Angeles being a chaotic big city. But this time, I grew some more liking to
				California. The scariest thing happened while climbing down from Sequoia,
				my brake pads had gone! But I managed to make it to a small town, repaired
				the brake pads and safely made it back to home. I hiked a trail called
				Little Baldy Trail in Sequoia, it had amazing view on top. I also did a
				very short hike at Kings Canyon, called Zumwalt Meadow Loop Trail. Overall,
				I really liked the views of Kings Canyon. The Canyon was so deep and the
				river through the canyon looked like a string from the top. I was lucky to
				hit Sequoia on a weekday when there was no crowd at all and I got the trail
				almost entirely to myself. There was a very nice lake from my way to
				Sequoia to Visalia (a small town), called Lake Kaweah. I stayed at two
				small towns during the trip: Visalia and Frenso. I also stayed at San Jose
				and loved the downtown Palo Alto. On my way back, I passed through the
				famous golden gate bridge. Then I stayed the night at Medford, Oregon. On
				the way to Medford, I saw the beautiful Mount Shasta. The drive from San
				Jose to Seattle was very pretty, I first saw mount Shasta, followed by
				Mount Hood, Mount St. Helens, and, finally, the majestic Mount Rainier!

				Today's <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/39767677"
				target="_blank">airbnb<a> was fantastic. It is located at an upscale
				neighborhood and a very large one. It even had an outside patio with a
				BBQ area. I loved the wreath at the entrance door! Today I ordered food
				from some local restaurant called <a

				& Grill</a> via Uber Eats. This too worked out very well.
