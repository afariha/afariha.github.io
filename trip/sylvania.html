				Today was so sunny that it compensated for yesterday's weather.
				The temperature was in the low 40s, still pretty chilly, but absolutely no
				cloud in the sky. The journey was pretty smooth, easy drive, only one stop
				at McDonald's. I didn't need to even refuel today. I crossed two state
				borders: Pennsylvania and Ohio. The moment I entered Ohio, suddenly the
				speed limit became 70. It has been a while since I have seen any speed
				limit higher than 65. For some weird reason, the maximum speed limit posted
				in the entire new England area is 65, which I call <em>unrealistic speed
				limits</em>, as no one every obeys such a low speed limit. When I started
				yesterday, I was seeing most cars with MA license plates, then I started
				seeing fewer, and now absolutely no MA cars. It is a very clear reminder
				that I am actually far from MA. I was getting glimpses of Lake Erie, which
				is kind of like an ocean, while driving. There were many cars (including a
				lot of police cars) beyond boring trucks today. I once thought to stop by
				Niagara falls, and also Rock & Roll Hall of Fame at Cleveland, but then I
				didn't. I wasn't really feeling like to add one hour to the driving.
				Sylvania is a small city, in fact it is very close to the larger city,
				Toledo.

				Today's <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/39767677"
				target="_blank">airbnb<a> was fantastic. It is located at an upscale
				neighborhood and a very large one. It even had an outside patio with a
				BBQ area. I loved the wreath at the entrance door! Today I ordered food
				from some local restaurant called <a
				href="https://www.blackrockrestaurants.com/" target="_blank">Black Rock Bar
				& Grill</a> via Uber Eats. This too worked out very well.

				I instantly liked the bedroom, it was so roomy, clean, and
				<em>white</em>, and most importantly, had a big window. I spent the entire
				afternoon and evening in the nice, warm, lovely sunlight coming through
				this window. I even attended a zoom meeting while enjoying the lovely
				afternoon! Although I promised myself that I won't work during this trip,
				but in my defense, it was neither a <em>hard</em> promise, nor the meeting
				was <em>real</em> work.
